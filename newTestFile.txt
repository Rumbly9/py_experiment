Hello, user!
----------------------------
The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. 
Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); 
parentheses (()) can be used for grouping.
